# Dancing AI Training App
To teach dance moves for anyone interested with the help of an animated 3D character. And to make it more interesting, we intend to include the option to upload a dance video and make the 3D character dance in tandem with the dancer in the video.

## Synopsis

The website allows the user to upload a dance video and converts it into moves that the 3D character performs. The user can control the speed of the movements and can confirm the accuracy of his/her movements by giving access to a camera. We use Computer Vision to compare the user's movement to that of the 3D character. We also give Step-by-Step tutorials to learn Shuffle Dance.

Furthermore, we teach the 3D AI character to learn from a set of (shuffle) dance videos to train itself, and it creates a trained model. When we play a song or a track, the 3D character starts dancing. The dance moves will depend on the song or track pattern. The training involves learning from two simultaneous inputs - video (to track moves of the dancer from a music video) and audio (music from the video).
